# Domain Invariant Representation Learning and Sleep Dynamics Modeling for Automatic Sleep Staging: A Deep Learning Framework

## Introduction
This repository contains source code for paper "**DREAM**: Domain Invariant and Contrastive Representation for Sleep Dynamics" (ICDM 2022).

Sleep staging has become a critical task in diagnosing and treating sleep disorders to prevent sleep-related diseases. With rapidly growing large-scale public sleep databases and advances in machine learning, significant progress has been made toward automatic sleep staging. However, previous studies face some critical problems in sleep studies: (1) the heterogeneity of subjects' physiological signals, (2) the inability to extract meaningful information from unlabeled sleep signal data to improve predictive performances, (3) the difficulty in modeling correlations between sleep stages, and (4) the lack of an effective mechanism to quantify predictive uncertainty.

In this paper, we propose a neural network-based model named **DREAM** that learns domain generalized representations from physiological signals and models sleep dynamics for automatic sleep staging. **DREAM** consists of (i) a feature representation network that learns sleep-related and subject-invariant  representations from diverse subjectsâ€™ sleep signal segments via VAE architecture and contrastive learning, and (ii) a sleep stage classification network that models sleep dynamics by capturing interactions between sleep segments and between sleep stages in the sequential context at both feature representation and label classification levels via Transformer and CRF models. Our experimental results indicate that **DREAM** significantly outperforms existing methods for automatic sleep staging on three sleep signal datasets. Further, **DREAM** provides an effective mechanism for quantifying uncertainty measures for its predictions, thereby helping sleep experts intervene in cases of highly uncertain predictions, resulting in better diagnoses and treatments for patients in real-world applications.
